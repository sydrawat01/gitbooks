# ‚è≠ NextJS

## What is [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)?

NextJS calls itself a **React framework for Production.** This is true because it makes building large scale production ready React apps easier with a lot of in-built features, which we will be discussing below! We can also call this a `fullstack` React framework.

But let's talk about the `framework` part here, since React is just a library, whereas NextJS is a framework. React deals with the client side code, which makes building front-end user interfaces easier to build than in plain JavaScript. It's called a library for this reason alone, since it is focused only on the user-interface, components, props, etc. If we need to build a large scale application, we need to add third party libraries for routing, authentication, etc. NextJS is labeled a "framework" for this reason, since it provides all such features out-of-the-box and builds up on the  React library.

The difference between a framework and a library is that a framework is larger and has more features than a library. It is focused on more things instead of just one single thing. It also provides clear rules and guides on how to write your code, structure your files, etc. All in all, NextJS solves common problems and makes building React apps easier!
