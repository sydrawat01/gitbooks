## What's this?

These are the notes  I've prepared, personally, for my understanding, while I was learning React. I've covered a wide range of topics, some of them go deep, and some of them are just an overview of the features / external libraries in React.

## Why did I make this?

It's pretty straight forward, I'm a person who likes to take notes by writing something down on a physical notebook, with an ink pen (call me old-fashioned!), but I believe the ease of accessibility to notes stored on the cloud, or hosted on a site, is way more convenient. Better code blocks, screenshots, and well-structured notes make my day! Another advantage I find with this approach is, easy click links to the official docs of things, increasing the accessibility!

## What to expect?

Well, nothing honestly. If you liked this small project of mine, big thanks! :)

I've put in a lot of hours into this, hopefully it will help most of you. In case you have any issues, or something I've written is wrong,  feel free to reach out to me on [sydrawat@gmail.com](mailto:sydrawat@gmail.com). I'm all ears for constructive criticism.

I'm in the process of making one for react-native! Feel free to reach out to me if you feel like contributing to it! You can check it out [here](https://sydrawat.gitbook.io/react-native/).
